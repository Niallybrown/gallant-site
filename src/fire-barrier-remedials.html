						In the event of a fire, cavity barriers are crucial to reducing the spread of flames and smoke. They work by blocking the passage of fire between cavities.</p>
					<div class="content-columns">
						<p>Following on from the Grenfell disaster, the Hackitt report was issued in December 2017, this identified that the current system of building regulations and fire safety was not fit for pur- pose and that a culture change was required to support the delivery of buildings that are safe, both now and in the future.<br /><br />
							The government have now implemented a building a safer future charter. This outlines the requirements and programme for improving fire safety protection within existing high-rise resi- dentials buildings.</p>
						<p>The majority of UK’s largest house builders have now signed up and pledged support to upgrading the fire barrier protection within their existing buildings.<br /><br />
							Gallant Brickwork has built a specialist division to provide fire barrier remedial services for the rapidly changing and challenging existing building facades safer construction legislation. We have developed our existing expertise to accommodate the ever-changing construction requirement’s. Our structured approach en- sures continued success in this sector.</p>
