              In the event of a fire, cavity barriers are crucial to reducing
              the spread of flames and smoke. They work by blocking the passage
              of fire between cavities.

                Following on from the Grenfell disaster, the Hackitt report was
                issued in December 2017, this identified that the current system
                of building regulations and fire safety was not fit for purpose
                and that a culture change was required to support the delivery
                of buildings that are safe, both now and in the future.<br><br>
                The government have now implemented a building a safer future
                charter. This outlines the requirements and programme for
                improving fire safety protection within existing high-rise
                residential buildings.

                The majority of UK’s largest house builders have now signed up
                and pledged support to upgrading the fire barrier protection
                within their existing buildings.<br><br>
